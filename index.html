        <h2>Let me introduce myself…</h2>
        <div class="card-content">
          <img src="images/calculator.svg" alt="">
          <p>I come from an accounting & finance background where I dealt with numbers. I have gained some experiences in medium and big size audit firms (such as Deloitte and BDO) back in the Netherlands. Soon after I realized that I was looking for a more adventurous career path and as China was (and still is) booming, I packed my bag, and moved to China. From that moment on, the rest is history… </p>

        <div class="card-content">
          <img src="images/designer.svg" alt="">
          <p>I was very amazed by the technological development, the fast-growing economy and the rapid adaption of consumers in this gigantic market. I wanted to be part of this. I joined a digital design company to manage their operations, and at the same time to learn about the digital scene here in China.</p>

          <p>The digital experience was a great stepping stone for me to get into the tech world. Beginning of 2018, I became the product manager of a tech startup in sport, YEYU. I helped to develop their mobile application and WeChat Mini Program. I enjoy managing apps, however, to be a good product manager, the technical skills were essential.</p>

        <h2>Sport</h2>
        <p>Besides working(or mainly coding lately), I love doing sport in my free time. I have competed in squash for some years and since 3 years ago my attention has gone to practicing combat sports such as thai boxing and brazilian jiu jitsu.</p>
